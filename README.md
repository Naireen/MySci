This is the first Android project I used to learn about mobile app delopment. I designed an app with my sister which is capable of common basic functions usind in highschool physics and chemistry classes. It had the information of the periodic table (eg. atomic config, properties, etc), can solve kinematic equations, balance chemical equations and more.
